# DREAM JOURNAL

This is a dream journalling application.

Running dream.sh will open up a file for today where you can record your dream.
If a file for today already exists it will open the file pointing towards the end, so you can record multiple dreams per day.

Files will exist in a subdirectory that looks like "YYYY/MM" with a filename that looks like "YYYY-MM-DD" 


## TODO
 - write script to read dreams on certain date
 - write compile set of dreams spanning a time frame
 - remove hardcoding of executable/storage directory
